## Notes
- This is still a pre-alpha mod. Bugs are meant to be expected.
- You might get better performance, but you also might get worse.

## Installation

- Make sure you already have [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) in your system.
- Move `VulkanMod.jar` to `mods` folder of your Minecraft Instance.

## Known Issues

- Linux and macOS is not working at the moment. I'm looking into it.
- For the M1 Macs (arm64), there has been a workaround thanks to [ViRb3](https://github.com/ViRb3) and use ManyMC. See below for installing it on ManyMC
